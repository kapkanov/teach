# Interpreter vs compiler

Practice!


# What is a program

Is it a text like programming language or a set of bytes?


# Assembly and ISA

- [x86 instruction listing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings)
- [x86 syscalls](https://x86.syscall.sh/)
- [./prep/hola.asm](./prep/hola.asm)
- Don't forget about `xxd`!

# Operating system

[./prep/os.c](./prep/os.c)


# Libraries

It's just a reusable program files


# Decline in programming
